The SNOMED CT is provided in UTF-8 encoded tab-delimited flat files which can be imported into any database or other software application.  SNOMED CT is not software.

The SNOMED CT files are designed as relational tables with each line in the file representing a row in the table. The first row of each table contains column headings. All other rows contain data.
